# COMP10001
WORKSHEET AND LECTURE MATERIAL
PROJECTS ARE 2023 SUMMER

NOTE:
1. IF you search COMP10001 and find my stuff, and you copy my code, even Jesus can't save you.
2. Just to find out how short the codes can be, I let ChatGPT optimize it!!! 
    I used it personally because I found that list comprehension is sth hard for me. I can do it, but I don't have the mind set for it.
    Also, some of the stuff can be done through library these days, I am trying to catch up the trend.
3. It is such a bad idea to copy it instead of understanding it that you are walking on a minefield.

STH FROM BOTTOM OF MY HEART:
If you are doing COMP10001 right now and see this:
  - I don't know your code level.  But I know that there are smurfs that started coding at very young age and they still took the CS course. Those motherfuckers would say things like "I still learn stuff in this course, blah blah blah.." Doesn't change the fact that they are smurfs. BUT, if you love CS and you are worried cuz of those smurfs, don't give up. FK them!
  - If you have no idea why you are learning CS, and not sure if this is the right path to take. Drop the course and pick something you like. I mean it. All the students were flowing into CS these days, the job market is bit fked up. People are getting fired in huge tech companies. Those good old days are long gone. 
  - It took me two years to figure out which way I am going. During that two years, I got zero passion in it. That was a waste of life time.(I am immortal by the way, just needs time to prove it.XD Time is still precious tho)
  - Took a gap year if you want to. Try the exchange program. Go around the world, and see what everyone is doing. You get a better picture of your own future.
  
  God bless you all!
